Create a mockup of the Final Project. The mockup must, at a minimum, provide a representation of the content structure and visual layout of the site. Other aspects of the site should also be represented including colour palette, typography, logos, and imagery.

Here is the link to Algonquin College Visual Identity Standards for inspiration and if you wish to follow the Algonquin College branding guidelines.

The mockup should have all 4 pages that your team has decided to build(3 required pages + 1 page from the 2 given options). You are to create 2 versions of each page, one for desktop and one for mobile. The branding and common elements of the page should match on all the mockups.

Each page should have Student Name and Student Number of the team member working the that page.

Combine your mockups in 2 PDF files, one for mobile and one for desktop. Each PDF should contain mockup of the 4 pages of your website.

Submission

Create a folder named mockups in your final project repository and add the 2 PDF files to the folder. Push your addition to GitHub pages. Submit the URL of your Github repository.
